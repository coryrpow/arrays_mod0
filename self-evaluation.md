# Question 1
I feel somewhat confident so far. I think there is a little confusion as to how booleans would be useful in this form. Like, if there are more than two true or falses, it would be difficult to know which one is being referred to, possibly. But maybe this is just more to integrate all the variables we learned and not really as important in real world applications?
# Question 2
I feel confident enough in them to use them in the coming lessons. I think I want to work on thinking of a way to remember to count 0 until it becomes habit. I recognized that counting the commas makes it easier to remember the 0 as a possible index position. 
# Question 3
Is there a Best Practice for what is "too many" elements in a single array? Or is this somewhat infinite depending on it's application? Like if a site is constantly adding new elemnts into the array code, then it must be, right? Not sure if that makes sense, but just curious if having too many affects how code runs or if it doesn't affect it in that way.
